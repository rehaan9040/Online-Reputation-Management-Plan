This document focuses on creating an effective online reputation management (ORM) strategy aimed at shaping how a brand is perceived across digital platforms. The task is centered around building trust, managing public perception, and responding proactively to both positive and negative feedback. It begins by highlighting the importance of monitoring online mentions using tools like Google Alerts and social media platforms to stay aware of public sentiment. The plan then outlines a clear approach for addressing negative reviews—responding calmly, apologizing sincerely, offering solutions, and moving the conversation to private channels when necessary. In addition, it emphasizes the importance of encouraging positive reviews through follow-ups, direct review links, and small engagement initiatives like giveaways. Tools such as Hootsuite and Canva are recommended to streamline monitoring and promote positive feedback visually. Overall, this task illustrates how consistent communication, active listening, and genuine engagement can help maintain and enhance a brand’s reputation in today’s feedback-driven online environment.
